# Pending Patterns - Code that passed execution but didn't match known patterns
# Review these and add valid ones to implementation_patterns.yml

# Example entries (to be populated during grading):

# R4_candidate_001:
#   student: "StudentName"
#   requirement: "R4"
#   code_snippet: "if (speedSet <= 0) throw new IncorrectSpeedException();"
#   execution_result: "PASSED"
#   status: "NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW"
#   date: "2026-02-11"
#   reason: "Code passed execution tests but pattern not in implementation_patterns.yml"

# R5_candidate_001:
#   student: "StudentName"
#   requirement: "R5"
#   code_snippet: "if (this.speedLimit != null && speedSet <= this.speedLimit)"
#   execution_result: "PASSED"
#   status: "NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW"
#   date: "2026-02-11"
#   reason: "Uses 'this.' prefix not in patterns"
